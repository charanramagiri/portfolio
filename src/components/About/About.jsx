        <h2>A little about me</h2>

        <p>
        I'm a final-year Computer Science student (B.Tech) focused on full stack web development. I build projects using React, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, and occasionally explore Machine Learning.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm actively seeking internship and entry-level full stack developer opportunities where I can apply what I've learned and continue growing.
        </p>

    </section>
