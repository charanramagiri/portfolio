        <p>
        I am a Computer Science undergraduate currently in my final year of B.Tech with a strong interest in full stack web development and problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have worked on academic and personal projects involving React, Flask, SQL, and Machine Learning. I am actively seeking internship and entry-level opportunities to apply my skills and grow as a software developer.
